# SDL2

## How to compile
1. Setup the library (Windows)
   - Download SDL2 for minGW if you're using that
   - Copy the x86 or x64 library folder into "C:/mingw_dev_libs" folder
   - Rename the x86 or x64 folder to "sdl2" 
   - If there's no SDL2.dll in the project folder, put it there (It is already present here)
2. Run the make file
   - If using mingw32-make: run "mingw32-make -f MakeFile"
3. Run the executable
   - Run the "./main.exe"
